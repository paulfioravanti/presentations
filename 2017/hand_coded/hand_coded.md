As a programmer your hands are a very important asset and your most used tools every day.<br />
Without them, not much coding is going to get done, so they're worth taking the time to invest in.

# [fit] SPEED

^
...the speed at which you can get things done on a computer, which is great in and of itself.<br />
But, much of the time we spend coding is not necessarily about banging out code fast, right? Way more time is spent thinking and problem-solving.<br />
But within our jobs, we don't tend to just write code.

So, as well as getting your thoughts into code quicker, learning to touch type will enable you to...

...spend more time doing the tasks that you want to do.

# :ok_hand:

You may say that you already type really fast in your own way and everything is fine.</br>
But touch typing also unlocks a couple more bonus developer perks.

The first being the ability to use a modal editor like Vim or Emacs.<br />
When I first saw Gary Bernhardt's Destroy all Software screencasts, his adeptness at Vim made it look like he was casting magic spells to navigate through a project and move chunks of text from one place to another, and that's when I knew I had to get in on this old-school editor and start manipulating data at...<br />

^
The second ability is to take better advantage of ergonomic keyboard options that can make your typing experience more pleasant (since we are on keyboards for many hours a day).<br />
They can also potentially reduce your risk of developing issues like carpal tunnel syndrome, so that you can continue coding comfortably for many more years to come, which is always a plus.

This is my keyboard here and its split design enables me to keep my shoulders straight and in a comfortable position.<br />
There aren't any legends on the keys cause it's all programmable and for some keys I've let my hands tell me what character they think should be at a particular key, different to a traditional keyboard layout.<br />
It may look strange if you've never seen this kind of keyboard before, but...

...would you think a piano would look strange with legends on it?  To me, it's now the same line of thought.

# **TRY** :pray:
# TOUCH TYPING

^
So, I would urge you to give learning to touch type a try if you haven't already, and even if
you have, I'd urge you to go back and try again

# I HAVE

I have failed to learn touch typing 4 times in my life, but through sheer stubborn persistence...

# I GOT IT
# ON THE **FIFTH**
# TIME :clap:

...I got it on the 5th time during my 30s, and have no regrets

---

# LEARNING IT
# IS A
# **GRIND** :punch:

^
It's tough to discipline yourself to practice typing every day until you become more efficient than with your old habits, and make no mistake, it's a grind.<br />
But any short term productivity hits or annoyances are so far outweighed by...

---

# LONG TERM
# **BENEFITS** :fist:

^
...the long-term benefits that I *promise* that you will not regret learning this skill.
