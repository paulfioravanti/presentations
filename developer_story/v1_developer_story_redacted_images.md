I actually found them doing some research for this talk and I put them up there to be representative not of code that I'm proud of, but what in hindsight I consider to be cringe-worthy code.<br />
No one starts writing good code, so I wanted to keep those pages around as a permanent reminder of that, and as a bit of a time capsule of the old guard of Japan's mobile internet.

And here we all are. See if you can spot me.<br />
Company training consisted of a 3 month bootcamp that, to me, felt like a compressed computer science degree, along with specialised cultural training that I'll get into in a little bit.<br />
About half of the class didn't come from a computing or quantitative background, so for many of them this was the first time they'd be learning how to use computers at such a low level.

#### Timesheet

^
The official work day began at 9:00am and ended at 5:30pm<br />
We were required to keep a timesheet and fill it out at the end of the day, and spot checks were done to make sure that we were keeping them up to date.<br />
Although the end of the official work day was 5:30pm, given the workload that we were expected to get through every day, there were plenty of times where we needed to stay back to get all of our work done.

However, we did not have permission to just stay late to get our work done.  We had to publicly manage our time: if we thought we wouldn't be able to finish our work before the end of the day, we had to make sure to report that to a supervisor and provide adequate reasons as to why we hadn't completed as much work as we expected.<br />
Then, we would make an on-the-spot estimate of how much longer the remaining day's work would take...

...and begin negotiations with the supervisor about how much extra overtime we would be permitted.<br />
Sometimes we'd get all the time that we asked for, sometimes we'd get less and told to report back yet again if the extra time apportioned didn't end up being enough, along with appropriate reasons as to why you didn't think the time given was enough.

#### Work
#### Report

^
We submitted a work report for every day of training and all reports needed to be hand-written with pencils and rulers on company graph paper.<br />
This is one of my early reports, and you can see that each report got corrected and commented on by the trainers, just like your teachers may have done for you in high school.

30 minutes before the end of the official work day, we would have to stop what we were doing and begin writing the report.<br />
If we thought we were unable to finish writing the report within the 30 minute time limit, then we would have to report this to the training supervisors and attempt to negotiate some more time to finish the report.<br />
If you did not let a training supervisor know you needed more time at least 10 minutes before the deadline, it was assumed that you would be completing your report.

# [fit] Java

Then, they would be graded by the training supervisors who would give you a pass or fail.  If you got a fail, you'd have to go back to that exercise, fix the failure, and re-submit.<br />
The rules around code submission were insanely strict, and each set of exercises had their own coding standards to adhere to.

---

# [fit] **Coding**
# [fit] **_Standards_**

^
The stated reason for this strictness was to get us to be conscious of following coding standards of any kind: you may end up being assigned to some project where the client has specified that code must be written in a certain way, so as well as writing the actual code, you'd have to be cognizant of *how* you're writing the code.

Once we'd done the Java basics, we had an individual program creation project, which, as you would perhaps expect, had us taking everything that we had learned in previous modules and create a Java program.<br />
My project ended up being a game of Othello. The deliverable for this, of course, included not just code, but all the associated documentation like a schedule, specifications, daily work reports, a user manual, and Javadoc.

Unfortunately, the rate of pay for a software developer is quite low over in Japan, especially for local companies as they tended to outsource a lot of work out to neighbouring countries where the labour rates were even lower.<br />

# [fit] **Audience**

^
From a presentations point of view, it taught me that when I was going to be placed before an audience I had to have some inkling of who that audience was and what they wanted to hear from me.<br />

---

# [fit] **_CEO_** :arrow_right: **_High Level_**

^
CEOs don't care about low-level technical information; they want to hear about how you can help them solve business problems and contribute to their bottom line.<br />

---

# [fit] **_CTO_** :arrow_right: **_Lower Level_**

^
CTOs are more interested in reducing system maintenance burdens and increasing their tech teams potential to deliver for the business side, and are generally interested in how your proposal will fit into their systems architecture at a low level.<br />
So, for both of these audiences you have to aim your pitches differently and zero in on what each party wants in order to be able to sell effectively. It's pretty much social engineering.

---

# [fit] **Communication**
# [fit] **_is part of_**
# [fit] **Coding**

^
When I finally did my loop back into full time coding again, I realised just how important development of these communications skills was, especially when it came to doing things like providing transparency on what you're currently working on and why, or pitching a new technology stack that I would like to use to someone who is non-technical.<br />
It came down to the question of "Can I get you to agree with me", with a best case scenario of the other party thinking that what I wanted them to do was their idea.

After getting tired of working Tokyo hours, I went and lived in Italy for 9 months...

...which was absolutely wonderful and I can recommend "mini-retirements" to absolutely anyone.<br />
At the time I actually intended to live and work in Italy as a Ruby developer.  I wanted to get back into the swing of development because although I'd learned a lot in my other job types, I'd really missed the creative aspects involved in building things with software, specifically in Ruby.

I did manage to secure myself a job as a Ruby dev in Milan, but when I found out how much the company were offering...

# :disappointed:

...it was less than what I was getting as a developer in Japan, and not nearly enough to live on in a big city like Milan.

# Italian Ruby Day :it:

^
After talking to some Italian developers at Italian Ruby Day, they told me that that there were quite a few cases where if a dev could speak English, they'd move to the UK, and if not, they'd move to Berlin, or perhaps somewhere in eastern Europe like Poland where tech scenes were really emerging at the time.

---

# [fit] Time to go

^
So, I unfortunately came to the realisation that I wasn't going to be able to stay in Italy for as long as I wanted.<br />
If I needed money my best bet was going to be in Australia, and if I was going to do that then it still needed to be as a Ruby developer.

# [fit] **Concerns**

^
However, I had a few concerns that I needed to figure out a strategy for, which may be similar to the kinds of things that junior developers worry about:

---

# **Concerns**<br />
## **_1. Programming Gap_**

^
1. I had a programming gap in my resume of many years.  I may have been in tech, but project consulting and pre-sales would probably be considered "post tech", and not applicable for a purely coding position.

---

# **Concerns**<br />
## **_1. Programming Gap_**
## **_2. Stale Skills_**

^
2. Since the gap was so big, I was worried that my skills had become stale and obsolete.  

---

# **Concerns**<br />
## **_1. Programming Gap_**
## **_2. Stale Skills_**
## [fit] **_3. No Local Experience_**

^
3. I had no "local experience".  I was anticipating getting responses like "well, I can see you had some experience a few years ago in Japan as a developer, but things work a bit different around here", and I didn't have any local references.

---

# [fit] Public
# [fit] Presence

^
I figured that in order to solve these problems I needed to have some kind of public presence or portfolio that would demonstrate that I could still actually code, and that I could explain and solve technological problems, with some kind of validation of this from third parties who I don't have any previous relationship with.<br />
So, I turned to two services that I'm sure you're very familiar with by now...

^
...Github and StackOverflow.<br />
I put anything and everything code-wise up on Github, which included code I wrote when following textbooks or tutorials, or even interview coding tests, along with as many README badges as possible that were related to code quality so a potential employer or recruiter wouldn't think I was completely "post-tech".<br />
On StackOverflow, I created an account and asked and answered as many questions as I could under tags that I was interested in, with a goal of reaching an amount of reputation that would at least look okay if I was to put it on my resume.

---

# [fit] **Engage**
# [fit] **_the_**
# [fit] **_Community_**

^
Since I didn't have any local references, before I got back to Australia I looked up what Ruby-based community groups existed and made a beeline for them as soon as I got back to Australia: both to get known, and make new friends and work contacts.

---

# [fit] **"Senior"**
# [fit] **_Developer_**

^
In the end the strategies paid off as I was able to get interviews with companies in Sydney without any local experience, and when they asked me what level developer I thought I was. I just said "senior" and they believed me, so that's what I've been working as since, which is nice.<br />
There's no ceremony where you get knighted into the league of senior developers, so although you do need to back up your claims with some level of competency, that level can vary quite drastically between organisations, so I've found that it's best to sell yourself high, and leave the burden to others to take you down a few pegs if needed.

---

# [fit] **Now**

^
So, that pretty much brings us to the point where I'm standing here talking to you, and I guess if I was to attempt to sum up what I've talked about here into some kind of takeaways, I think I would probably list them out as:

---

# [fit] **Enjoy _the_**
# [fit] **_journey_**

^
I hope you're enjoying your coding journey. If you are, it'll show when you go and interview and endear yourself to your interviewer, and it'll help motivate you as you progress.

---

# [fit] `git push`
# [fit] **_Often_**

^
Make as much of your code as possible public, even if you think it's not your best work; you can iterate on it later. Give yourself a rich public profile.

---

# [fit] **Communicate**

^
Don't forget your human communication skills as they're just as important as coding, especially if you land a remote position without an office.

---

# [fit] **Go _to_**
# [fit] **_Meetups!_**

^
Meetups are a great place to meet your people and every Ruby meetup there is always a section for people looking for and offering work.<br />
The next Ruby on Rails Oceania meetup, known as RORO, which I'm a co-organiser of, is on *tomorrow* at Pivotal Labs, so please consider signing up today and coming to see what's going on in the Ruby community.  I'm sure you will have lots of fun, and at the very least you'll get free food and drinks out of it!
