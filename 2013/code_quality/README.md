# Code Quality: Tools and Services

This is a presentation I gave on the tools and services I use to try
and make me a better Ruby programmer.

It was originally delivered in person to the
[Adelaide.rb meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/adelaiderb/)
on January 8, 2013.

The Keynote file used to make this presentation isn't included in this
repository as it's over 1 GB in size, but ff you really want it for some reason,
you can [contact me](https://twitter.com/paulfioravanti).
