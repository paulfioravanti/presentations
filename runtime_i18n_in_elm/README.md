# Runtime I18n in Elm

A presentation about the deceptively difficult problem of internationalisation
([i18n][]) in [Elm][], focusing mostly on language switching at [run time][],
as opposed to [compile time][].

Presented at:

- :performing_arts: [Sydney Elm meetup on 21 June 2018][elmsyd]

The Markdown file for the presentation, which includes speaker notes, can
be used in [Deckset][], and is best viewed in Raw form.
