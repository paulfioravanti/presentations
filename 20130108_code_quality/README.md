# Code Quality: Tools and Services

This is a presentation I gave on the tools and services I use to try
and make me a better Ruby programmer.

It was originally delivered in person to the
[Adelaide.rb meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/adelaiderb/)
on January 8, 2013.

The keynote file used to make this presentation isn't included in this
repository as it's over 1 GB in size, but the slides in PDF form, along
with a set of separate slide notes are.

If you really want the Keynote file for some reason, you can
