# Code Quality: Tools and Services

This is a presentation I gave on the tools and services I use to try
and make me a better [Ruby][ruby] programmer.

Presented at:

- :performing_arts: [Adelaide.rb meetup group][adelaide-rb] on January 8, 2013

The Keynote file used to make this presentation isn't included in this
repository as it's over 1 GB in size, but if you really want it for some reason,
you can [contact me][twitter-url].
